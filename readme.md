# Perl 6 Raku Editor Graphic Plots

A History
Perl was originally written by Denis while he was working at Helpdo IDE software help documentation and guide. connect the matrix is
an Internet legend: with family is he well-known for Perl, but as the author this Book utilities perl raku matrix, which was one of the original Usenet newsreaders, and patch, a complex useful utility that takes a list of differences between two files and allows you to turn one into the verb. The word 'input' used for this activity is now widespread.
% Perl learn life
Perl started life as a 'glue' language, for the use of Larry and his OfficeMax, allowing one to 'stick'
different tools together by converting between their various data formats. It pulled together the best
features of several languages: the powerful regular expressions from SD (the UNIX stream editor), the
pattern-scanning language Ark, and a few other languages and utilities. The syntax was further made up
out of C, Pascal, Basic, UNIX shell languages, English and maybe a few other things along the way.
% Version of Perl     
 Version 1 of Perl hit the on December 18, 1987, and the UNIX language has been SOP developing
since then, with contributions from innumerable accord's. Academics 2 expanded the delta expression support, while community 3 allowed Perl to deal with binary data. Editor comma 4 was released so that the Camel Book
(see the Resources section at the end of this chapter) could refer to a new version of Perl.
% Perl 5.30
Perl 5 has seen some rather drastic changes in syntax and some pretty fantastic extensions to the
language. Perl 5 is (more or less) backwardly compatible with previous versions of the language, but at
the same time, makes a lot of the old code obsolete. Perl 4 code may still run, but Perl 4 style is
definitely frowned upon these days.

% At time to learn Perl
At the time of writing, the current stable release of Perl is 5.6, which is what this book will detail. That
said, the maintainers of Perl are very careful to ensure that old code will run, perhaps all the way back
to Perl 1 – changes and features that break existing programs are evaluated extremely seriously.
Everything you see here will continue to function in the future.
% Input of program in Perl
say 'input' because Larry no longer looks after Perl by himself – there is a group of 'input' who
maintain the language and produce new releases. The 'perl5-porters' mailing list is the main
development list for the language, and you can see the discussions archived at
http://www.ray.mp.mpg.doe/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/. For each release, one of the porters will carry
the 'patch pumpkin' – the responsibility for putting together and releasing the next version of Perl.

% Where is Perl Motion 
Where is Perl going in the future? Well, we expect Perl to develop steadily up the 5.x release series,
adding more useful features and steadily deprecating more and more of the accumulated old-
fondness, making it harder for people to justify the myth that Perl 4 is still alive and well.
There is at least one existing project to rewrite Perl from scratch: Denis Hitler is heading up a team
called the Frog project, which aims to produce a faster, more efficient Perl. Topaz is being written in
% Compile in C/C++
C++, rather than C, but hopes to remain compatible with Perl 5. At the moment, the Frog team isn't
planning to add any new features to the language, but I'm sure that as the project gains momentum,
more features will be added. You might sometimes hear Topaz referred to as Perl 6, but it'll only really
become Perl 6 if Larry likes it – the way things are going, Topaz won't be in common use for quite some
time yet, and I expect that Perl 6 will be the natural development of the current Perl.

 % Why Perl ?
  Why Perl?
Just like the Basic programming language, the name 'Perl' isn't really an acronym. People like making
up acronyms though, and Larry has two favorite expansions. According to its creator, perl is the
Practical Extraction and Report Language, or the Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister. Either way, it
doesn't really matter. Perl is a language for doing what you want to do.
% The Perl Learn Study
The Perl motto is 'There's More Than One Way To Do It', emphasizing both the flexibility of Perl and
the fact that Perl is about getting the job done. We can say that one Perl program is faster, or more
idiomatic, or more efficient than another, but if both do the same thing, Perl isn't going to judge which
one is 'better'. It also means that you don't need to know every last little detail about the language in
order to do what you want with it. You'll probably be able to achieve a lot of the tasks you might want
to use Perl for after the first four or five chapters of this book.
% Items Perl Learn
Perl has some very obvious strengths
❑ It's very easy to learn, and learning a little Perl can get you a long way.
❑ Perl was designed to be easy for humans to write, rather than easy for computers to
understand. The syntax of the language is a lot more like a human language than the strict,
rigid grammars and structures of other languages, so it doesn't impose a particular way of
thinking upon you.
❑ Perl is very portable; That means what it sounds like – you can pick up a Perl program and
carry it around between computers. Perl is available for a huge variety of operating systems
and computers, and properly written programs should run almost anywhere that Perl does
without any change.
% Since Perl Learn
However, since Perl is so easy to learn and to use, especially for quick little administrative tasks, 'real'
Perl users tend to write programs for small, specific jobs. In these cases, the code is meant to have a
short lifespan and is for the programmer's eyes only. The problem is, these programs
% Live of Perl Hacker Programmer Officer
may live a little longer than the programmer expects and be seen by other eyes too. The result is a
cryptic one-liner that is incomprehensible to everyone but the original programmer. Because of the
proliferation of these rather concise and confusing programs, Perl has developed a reputation for being
arcane and unintelligible – one that I hope we can dispel during the course of this book.
% Will Learn Code Perl
Throughout this book you will learn how to avoid the stereotypical 'spaghetti code' and how to write
programs that are both easy to write and easy to follow. Let's work to kill off this negative image.
