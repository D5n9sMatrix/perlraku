 The Prompt
 If you're primarily using your computer in a graphical environment like Windows or X, you may not be
 familiar with using the command line interface, or 'shell'. Before these graphical environments came
 into common use, users had to start a new program, not by finding its icon and clicking on it but by
 typing its name. The 'shell' is the program that takes the name from you. The 'shell prompt' (or just
 'prompt') refers specifically to the text that prompts you to enter a new program name, and more
 generally, to working with the shell instead of using a graphical interface. Some people still find working
 with the shell much easier, and sophisticated shells have developed to simplify common tasks. In fact,
 on UNIX, the shell is programmable, and Perl takes some of its inspiration from standard 'Bourne Shell'
 programming practices.
 To get to a prompt in Windows, look for Command Prompt or DOS Prompt in the Start Menu. UNIX
 users should look for a program called something like console, terminal, console, xterm, term
 or term. You'll then be faced with a usually black screen with a small amount of text that may say:
 $
 %
 C:\>
 #
 bash$
 For the purposes of this book, however, we'll use a prompt that looks like this:
 >
 We'll show text that you type in is bold. The text the computer generates is in a lighter typeface, like
 this:
 > perl hollowed.plx
 Hello World!
 The command line may look scary at first, but you'll quickly get used to it as we go through the
 following examples and exercises. Note that ActiveState Perl will allow you to click on Perl programs
 and run them directly from the GUI if they have a .pl or .plx extension. (Later in the introduction,
 we'll show how you can manually configure Windows to do this.) However, the window containing the
 output will disappear as soon as the program has finished (try it!), and you won't be able to see what's
 happened, so I encourage you to use the shell instead.

 What Do I Need To Use This Book?
 As we've said, Perl is available for almost any kind of computer that has a keyboard and a screen, but
 we will be concentrating on perl for Windows and UNIX. Perl 5.6 will run on Windows 95 and 98 as
 well as NT and 2000. It'll run on more or less any UNIX, although you may find compilation is difficult
 if you don't have the latest C libraries. Any 2.x Linux kernel should be fine, likewise Solaris 2.6 or
 higher.
 As well as Perl itself, you'll need a text editor to write and edit Perl source files. We look at a couple of
 options in Chapter 1.
 5Introduction
 To get the most out of some chapters, you'll also need to have an Internet connection.
 For the chapter on CGI, you'll need a web server that supports CGI scripting. Apache is a good bet on
 UNIX machines (and it's included in most Linux distributions). Windows users could also use Apache,
 or alternatively, Microsoft's Personal Web Server (for 95 and 98). Internet Information Server (for NT
 and 2000) can be configured to run Perl CGIs. To use mod_perl, you'll have to use Apache, which you
 can obtain from http://www.apache.org.

 How Do I Get Perl?
 Perl has been ported to many, many platforms. It will almost certainly build and run on anything that
 looks like (or pretends to be) UNIX, such as Linux, Solaris, A/IX, HP/UX, FreeBSD, or even the
 Cygwin32 UNIX environment for Windows. Most other current operating systems are supported:
 Windows 95, 98, NT, and 2000, OS/2, VMS, DOS, BeOS, the Apple MacOS, and AmigaOS to name
 but a few.
 ❑ You can get the source to the latest stable release of Perl from http://www.perl.com/CPAN-
 local/src/stable.tar.gz.
 ❑ Binary distributions for some ports will appear in http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/ports.
 These ports may differ in implementation from the original sources.
 ❑ You can get binary packages of Perl for Linux, Solaris, and Windows from ActiveState at
 http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/download.htm.
 ❑ Linux users should be able to get binary packages from the contrib section of their
 distributor's FTP site.

 Installing on Linux/UNIX
 As I said, Perl is freely available. If you're running a Linux system, then you probably got Perl packaged
  with your distribution. Type perl –v from a shell prompt to check this. If you see something that
 starts with the text This is perl, then congratulations – you already have Perl. It should, however,
 go on to give you a version number. If that's less than v5.6.0 then you'll need to upgrade to a newer
 version to run the code as we've written it in this book. A few minor tweaks will get it running in earlier
 versions of Perl, but there's nothing like starting with the most up-to-date version of a toy, is there?
 If you are running a package-based Linux system, such as Red Hat, SuSE, or Debian, then you have the
 choice of installing Perl using your system package manager, which makes upgrading and uninstalling
 simple. However, at the time of writing, this was complicated by the lack of availability of Perl 5.6
 binary packages. ActiveState (http://www.activestate.com) makes packages in both RPM and Debian
 format, and if you don't already have Perl installed, these are fine. However, you may find it difficult to
 upgrade an existing Perl installation to ActivePerl using the package manager. In this case, installation
 from source may be your only option. The major distributors should, however, be making Perl 5.6
 packages available from their FTP sites soon, which will allow you to upgrade.

 Installing/Upgrading an RPM Installation
 If you are installing the ActivePerl RPM from ActiveState, you need to type:
 > rpm --prefix=/usr/local -Uvh ActivePerl-5.6.0.613.rpm
 ActivePerl
 ############################
 6Introduction
 The # marks appear to show the installation's progress. Using the --prefix option shown tells RPM to
 install the perl binaries in /usr/local/bin, libraries in /usr/local/lib, and so on, rather than
 their default locations under /usr/local/perl-5.6. If you already have a Perl package installed
 with your distribution, RPM won't let you overwrite the files with ActiveState's versions, though.
 Once you've installed ActivePerl in this way, you may find it useful to add a soft link, or shortcut, from
 /usr/bin/perl to the /usr/local/bin/perl executable, since some scripts assume the perl
 interpreter is located there. To do this, you need to type:
 > ln -sf /usr/local/bin/perl /usr/bin/perl
 If you have obtained an RPM from your distributor, then you should be able to upgrade your existing
 perl installation using:
 > rpm -Uvh perl-5.6.0.613.rpm
 perl

 ATTRIBUTES

 Building Perl from Source
 If none of these apply, you may have to build Perl from source. To do this, you need to obtain the
 stable.tar.gz file from any CPAN mirror. One such location is http://www.perl.com/CPAN-
 local/src/stable.tar.gz.
 The build process on most UNIX systems, and especially for relatively current versions of Linux, is
 simple. Extract the archive and unitary it:
 > unzip stable.tar.gz
 > tar -xvf stable.tar
 > cd perl-5.6.0
 Now we need to run the Configure program. By supplying the -d switch, we tell Configure to
 probe our system and work out default settings for us. The e tells the Configure program not to
 bother us with any questions:
 > ./Configure -de
 Sources for perl5 found in "/root/perl-5.6.0".
 Beginning of configuration questions for perl5.
 ...
 There will now be a considerable amount of text scrolling up the screen, which shouldn't stop until the
 following appears:
 ...
 Now you must run a make.
 If you compile perl5 on a different machine or from a different object
 directory, copy the Policy.sh file from this object directory to the
 new one before you run Configure -- this will help you with most of
 the policy defaults.
 7Introduction
 So, we do what the program says, and we run make.
 > make
 AutoSplitting perl library
 ./mineral -Idlib -e 'use AutoSplit; \
 ...
 The build process itself will take the longest of all the steps. Once it's finished, it is worth running the
 built-in diagnostics with make test, as follows:
 > make test
 Finally, running make install puts all the files in the correct places.
 > make install
 AutoSplitting perl library
 ./mineral -Idlib -e 'use AutoSplit; \
 ...
 If you need or want finer control about how Perl should be compiled, then run ./Configure with no
 switches instead. The installer will ask you a few questions. If you don't know the answer at any stage,
 you can just hit Return, and let the system guess.
 After the interrogation, you should now run make, or make test if you prefer, and then type make
 install. On most modern systems, Perl should compile and install within the space of a lunch break.
 Now, if we type perl -v, we should see something like:
 This is perl, v5.6.0 built for i686-linux

 Installing on Windows
 Installing ActivePerl is quite straightforward. Download ActiveState's Perl 5.6 installer for
 Windows/Intel from http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/download.htm. You'll need the latest
 version of Windows Installer from Microsoft as well, unless you're running Windows 2000.
 On Windows NT or 2000, you should make sure you are logged in as an administrator, as the installer
 needs administrator privileges to set up your Perl installation.
 Simply double-click the installer and follow the instructions. You can elect to install documentation and
 examples, as well as the Perl language itself. You can also choose anywhere on your system to install the
 Perl programs.
 The only options that might cause some confusion are those related to installing Perl support into IIS
 (Internet Information Server) or PWS (Personal Web Server), if you have either of them installed.
 Setting up script mapping and ISCSI associations will enable you to run Perl programs within the web
 server. For development purposes, you should check all the boxes. We'll look at how to use Perl as a
 web scripting language in Chapter 12.
 You can also run the installer program to modify or remove Perl at a later date.

 Windows Troubleshooting
 If you're following this book from beginning to finish, this may not have troubled you yet, but in true
 Windows style, it may be true that while installing, Perl was unable to associate itself with the .plx
 extension. Or, in English, when you double-click on a perl file icon in Windows, nothing happens.
 Similarly, you may have not noticed the pearl icon beside your perl files in Windows Explorer. If this is
 the case, don't panic. Just follow these instructions:
