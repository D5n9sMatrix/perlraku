 Perl Resources
 There is a tremendous amount of Perl information available in books and on the Internet. Let's have a
 look at some of the more prominent ones.
 Websites
 On the web, the first port of call is http://www.perl.com/, the main Perl community site, run by the
 publisher O'Reilly. This contains some good articles of interest to the Perl community and news from
 Perl's major developers, as well as a wealth of links, tips, reviews, and documentation.
 It is also home to CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a collection of ready-made
 programs, documents, notably the latest edition of the FAQ, some tutorials, and the Far More Than
 Everything You Wanted To Know About (FMTEYWTKA) series of more technical notes. Most useful
 of all, this site contains a huge (and they don't call it comprehensive for nothing!) collection of those
 Perl modules mentioned above. We'll fully cover the use of modules and some of the best ones in a
 later chapter.
 13Introduction
 Because CPAN is a network of sites, there are mirror sites around the world – the
 CPAN multiplexer takes you to your nearest site. Find it at
 http://www.perl.com/CPAN (note: no trailing slash!)
 Other important Perl sites are:
 ❑ http://www.perlclinic.com/ – Paul Ingram's Perl Clinic, providing commercial Perl support and
 training
 ❑ http://www.perlfaq.com/ – an alternative, and very comprehensive, FAQ site
 ❑ http://www.tpj.com/ – the home of the Perl Journal
 ❑ http://www.activestate.com/ – the home of Perl on Windows
 ❑ http://www.perl.org/ – Perl Mongers, a worldwide umbrella organisation for Perl user groups
 ❑ http://www.perlarchive.com/ - another great source of articles, tutorials and information
 Newsgroups
 Perl is so cool it has its own Usenet hierarchy, comp.lang.perl.*. The groups in it are:
 ❑ comp.lang.perl.announce for Perl-related announcements: new modules, new versions of
 Perl, conferences and so on.
 ❑ comp.lang.perl.misc for general Perl chat and questions.
 ❑ comp.lang.perl.moderated, which requires prior registration before posting, but is excellent
 for sensible questions and in-depth discussion of Perl's niggly bits.
 ❑ comp.lang.perl.modules, for discussion and queries relating to creating and using Perl
 modules.
 ❑ comp.lang.perl.tk, for discussion and queries relating to the Tk graphical extensions.
 IRC
 If you've got a more urgent mindbender, or just want to hang around like-minded individuals, come join
 #perl on Efnet (See http://www.efnet.org/). Make sure you read the channel rules (at
 http://pound.perl.org/RTFM/) and the Perl documentation thoroughly first, though. Asking questions
 about CGI or topics covered in the FAQ or the perldoc documentation is highly inflammatory behavior.
 If that hasn't put you off, come over and say hi to me. (I have no imagination, so my nick is usually
 Simon.)
 Books
 Of course, reading stuff from the net is a great way to learn, but I can't curl up in bed with a good web
 site. Not until I get myself a laptop, anyway.
 In the meantime, there are a few good treeware resources available, too. O'Reilly has published some of
 the definitive books on Perl – Learning Perl (the Llama book), Programming Perl (the Camel book), and
 the Perl Cookbook are well known and well respected in the Perl community. Check out the book reviews
 pages housed at the http://www.perl.com/ and http://www.perl.org/ sites.
